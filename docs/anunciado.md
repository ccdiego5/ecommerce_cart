Hi Diego,

Thank you for applying for the job!

Instead of a traditional first call, we've recorded a short video to introduce you to our company, our culture, and the team you'd be working with.

Please take a look:

Step 2: The Practical Task

If you like what you see in the video and are excited to proceed, the next step is a practical task. This helps us see your skills in action.

We would like you to create a small project based on the following requirements:

Project: Simple E-commerce Shopping Cart

Create a project for a simple e-commerce shopping cart system. Users should be able to browse products, add them to a cart, update quantities, and remove items. Each product should have a name, price, and stock_quantity.

Please use any of Laravel’s starter kits - Livewire, React, or Vue—whichever you’re most comfortable with. (https://laravel.com/starter-kits)

Each shopping cart must be associated with the authenticated user (User model).
When a user adds products to their cart, updates quantities, or removes items, these actions should be stored and retrieved based on the currently authenticated user (not via session or local storage).
Make sure to use Laravel’s built-in authentication from the starter kit.

Keep it simple and follow laravel best practices and guidelines.

Tech Stack:

Backend: Laravel

Frontend: React, Vue or Livewire

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Version Control: Git/GitHub

Key Requirements:

Low Stock Notification: When a product's stock is running low, a Laravel Job/Queue should be triggered to send an email to a dummy admin user.

Daily Sales Report: Implement a scheduled job (cron) that runs every evening and sends a report of all products sold that day to the email of the dummy admin user.

Submission: Please host the code on GitHub and add @dylanmichaelryan as a collaborator to the repository.

Step 3: Your Submission & Walkthrough

When you have completed the task, please reply with:
The link to your GitHub repository.
A brief video (Loom is perfect for this) where you:
Showcase the working application.
Briefly explain your code/approach.
Let us know how long the task took you to complete.

Our Commitment
Once we receive your submission, we will review it and get back to you within 48 hours to schedule the next step (a personal interview).

We know this is a bit unconventional, but it's the most effective way for us to assess real-world skills. Please note, we are looking to hire quickly. Candidates who submit a strong task have a very high chance of receiving an offer, assuming a good match in the final interview (first come, first serve).
